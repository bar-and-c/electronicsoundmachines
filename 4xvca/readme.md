# ForexVCA

Or 4xVCA, the name is not decided yet. It is basically just the reference circuit from the V2164 data sheet. 

One change is that the CV input is designed to deliver 0V to the V2164 when there is 5V on the CV input – 0V in being unity gain of the VCA – and 0V on the CV input should render about 8V on the IC input (which hopefully means a quiet output). This is all untested at the time, though.
