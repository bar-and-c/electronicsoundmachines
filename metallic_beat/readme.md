# Metallic Beat

The CR-78 is my favourite drum machine, both the sounds and the patterns (it is like canned musicality), and the cymbal together with metallic beat was the sound(s) I wanted to build first. So far I have only finished the latter. 

The schematic is not completely finished yet, but soundwise it is usable (the final stage will soon be added to the schematic).

In addition to the service manual, lots of inspiration found in <http://electro-music.com/forum/topic-67084-25.html>, especially <http://electro-music.com/forum/phpbb-files/cr78_mb_607.png> (for me, the key to getting that kind of design to work was to lower R566 – I think it was designed to work with a negative trigger pulse).
