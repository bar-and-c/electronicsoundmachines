The CR-78 is my favourite drum machine, both the sounds and the patterns (it is like canned musicality), and the cymbal together with metallic beat was the sound(s) I wanted to build first. So far I have only finished the latter. 

The schematic is not completely finished yet, but soundwise it is usable (the final stage will soon be added to the schematic).
