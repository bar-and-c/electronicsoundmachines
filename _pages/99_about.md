The project called Electronic Sound Machines is at its grandest an attempt to combine the joy of creating stuff and music, with sharing knowledge about electronics. The backup plan is to at least have fun while trying. And bring fun. 

It is about DIY electronics, and finding out how things work. 

It is also about finding sound and music in unexpected materials. 

It will be about building things out of electronics and other things, and make sound. It is not the sole purpose, it is not just about putting a kit together; there will also be time for discussion about the circuits, to talk about what the components do, time for experimentation. You will learn how to solder, and gain at least a rudimentary understanding of analogue electronics. 

No previous knowledge is required, but if you DO have knowledge about electronics, soldering, etc., I would appreciate if you are willing to assist those in the group that need help. I have worked a bit with analogue audio electronics in the past, and have built a couple of guitar pedals, but I am by no means any electronics wizard. I truly believe that we can learn from each other.
