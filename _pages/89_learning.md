[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) have a nice site with learning material, with e.g. a collection of starter tutorials; it looks like a good place to dive in.

For the braver, here is a link to a few pages with a _lot_ of info about transistor circuits. Itâ€™s a massive amount of text to read, and not always very well structured, but there is a lot of good examples of practical electronics, and explanations.
