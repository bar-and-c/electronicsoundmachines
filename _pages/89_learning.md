Learning electronics is not necessarily that hard. At least not to get a basic understanding, enough to get a grip on how a distortion pedal works. Do not fret about getting all the information in, just try to understand the basic concepts; read about the closed circuit, voltage/current/resistance, and a little about diodes and transistors. That will take you a long way, and you will soon be able to impress your friends with new knowledge and vocabulary.

Here is a link to a brief page that give a high level overview of some steps in learning electronics. There is also a nice illustration of the connection between voltage, resistance, and current.

For a bit more actual learning, [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) run a nice site with learning material, with e.g. a collection of starter tutorials; it looks like a good place to dive in.

For the braver, who does not fear long rambling texts and hideous 90's style web site design, here is a link to a few pages with a _lot_ of info about transistor circuits. Itâ€™s a massive amount of text to read, and not always very well structured, but there is a lot of good examples of practical electronics, and explanations.
