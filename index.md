## Welcome to Electronic Sound Machines

The idea is to build stuff that makes sound, learn electronics, be creative, and have fun. The first series of workshops were about building a guitar pedal. Coming up are one or more workshops for building simple synthesizer modules – tiny and simple enough that they don't even need a power supply, they can just be hanging in the cables of your modular.

### [Build a ring modulator](ringmod)
This workshop will be held at Inkonst, as part of Eter Labs. Check their info for details.

### Event archive

#### [Build your own effect pedal](effectpedal)

Basically, the important facts are:
* The first meeting is on **March 28, 18:00 -  21:00**. 
* After that there will be a workshop every other Wednesday (maybe 2-3 times, depending on how fast we work vs. how much time we spend on learning/discussing/experimenting). 
* The workshop will take place in the basement at [STPLN](http://stpln.org) in [Västra Hamnen, Malmö](https://goo.gl/maps/Bw6hPB8zsJt).
* Signing up for the workshop is done by sending me a message, either on Facebook or by email (see bottom of page). The remaining few seats are reserved for women/non-dudes, hence this process. I will confirm your booking by emailing you back (you do not have a seat until you receive my confirmation email).
* **IMPORTANT:** If you want to order a pedal kit through me, the last date for that is **March 18**. It is OK to sign up later than that, but then you will have to get a kit on your own.
