## Welcome to Electronic Sound Machines

The idea is to build stuff that makes sound, learn electronics, be creative, and have fun. We will kick off with building a guitar pedal, and see where we will go after that.

### [Build your own effect pedal](effectpedal)

**[UPDATE]**
Since this workshop is starting to get fully booked, with a majority of dudes in the group, the remaining seats are reserved for those that are underrepresented in music and tech, e.g. women. 

The first series of workshops is about building an effect pedal, talk about what makes a fuzz fuzz, and things like that. Expect to spend one to three workshops on this (every other Wednesday), depending on how much you would want to experiment. It could probably be built on one occasion, but if we talk a lot about _how_ it works, it will take more than one occasion. Fear not, there are three Wednesdays booked.
Read more [on this page](guitarpedal), where you will find information about the event, where to get kits, and how to sign up. 

Basically, the important facts are:
* The first meeting is on **March 28, 18:00 -  21:00**. 
* After that there will be a workshop every other Wednesday (maybe 2-3 times, depending on how fast we work vs. how much time we spend on learning/discussing/experimenting). 
* The workshop will take place in the basement at [STPLN](http://stpln.org) in [Västra Hamnen, Malmö](https://goo.gl/maps/Bw6hPB8zsJt).
* Signing up for the workshop is done by sending me a message, either on Facebook or by email (see bottom of page). The remaining few seats are reserved for women/non-dudes, hence this process. I will confirm your booking by emailing you back (you do not have a seat until you receive my confirmation email).
* **IMPORTANT:** If you want to order a pedal kit through me, the last date for that is **March 18**. It is OK to sign up later than that, but then you will have to get a kit on your own.
