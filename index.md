## Welcome to Electronic Sound Machines

The idea is to build stuff that makes sound, learn electronics, be creative, and have fun. The first series of workshops were about building a guitar pedal, then there was one for building a ring modulator. The future is unknown, but something will happen. I am working on my (95% DIY) modular, there might be some workshops coming out of that, eventually. See more at [Malm√∂ Punk Modular](punkmod).
