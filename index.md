## Welcome to Electronic Sound Machines

The idea is to build stuff that makes sound, learn electronics, be creative, and have fun. We will kick off with building a guitar pedal, and see where we will go after that.

### [Build your own guitar pedal](guitarpedal)

The first series of workshops is about building a guitar pedal, talk about what makes a fuzz fuzz, and things like that. Expect to spend two or three workshops on this (every other Wednesday). 
Read more [on this page](guitarpedal), where you will find information about the event, where to get kits, and how to sign up. 

Basically, the important facts are:
* The first meeting is on **March 28, 18:00 -  21:00**. 
* After that there will be a workshop every other Wednesday (maybe 2-3 times, depending on how fast we work vs. how much time we spend on learning/discussing/experimenting). 
* The workshop will take place in the basement at [STPLN](http://stpln.org) in [Västra Hamnen, Malmö](https://goo.gl/maps/Bw6hPB8zsJt).
* Signing up for the workshop is done through a Google Forms thing, where you also choose which (if any) Moodysound pedal kit you want to buy. **[Here is the form for signing up](https://goo.gl/forms/xLp5W4ZByfZLMssz1&hl=en)**, and note that signing up (as well as ordering kits) is **binding**. There is a limited amount of seats, so I will confirm your booking by emailing you after you filled out the form.
* **IMPORTANT:** If you want to order a pedal kit through me, the last date for that is **March 18**.
