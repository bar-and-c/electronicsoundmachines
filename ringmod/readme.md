# Ring modulator


This is just a textbook example of a ring modulator (see Wikipedia for reference). Given two input signals, the input and the carrier, as I understand it the output is the sum and difference frequencies (in an ideal circuit the input frequencies should not be in the output at all). 

In a more non-mathematical language: given two inputs, the input and the carrier, the output can be a bit unpredictable and often rather disharmonic. It can be used to create bell like sounds, robotic voices, or even quite pleasant sounds (if the input frequencies are carefully selected). 

It is super easy to build, and easy to use as it requires no power supply, just two input signals (just not too low in amplitude, use a pre-amplifier if needed).
